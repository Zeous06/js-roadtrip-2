// Video 1.4 accompanies this exercise

// Write a basic for loop that prints to the console all
// the numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order. This is the similar to one
// of the previous challenges, but this time weâ€™re using a for loop instead
// of a while loop.
for(let number = 10; number >= 1; number--) {
  console.log(number)
}
// Wrong loop - the first and second condition requires that a loop continues
to run because 10 is greater than 1 and  the third contidion requires
to keep to the count for (let number = 10; number >= 1; number++)
within the third condition to for(let number = 10; number >= 1; number--)
the loop stops when the condition is false
therefore 0 is not greater than 1. loops stops.
